    defaultBio: ` I am a programmer with 10 years experience. I worked in the
                  development of large ERP solutions on the platform 1Ð¡:Enterprise (low-coding,
                  full-featured platform like SAP). I went from being an ordinary developer to the
                  head of the development team. During this time I have gained experience not only
                  in programming, but also in database design, business analysis, automated testing,
                  building workflows, developing standards and best practices, and of course
                  managing a team of developers. Although I had great success in 1C, I wanted more:
                  to go beyond the limits of a narrowly focused programming language, to study the
                  global development practices. And here RSSchool came into my lifeðŸ™‚`,
